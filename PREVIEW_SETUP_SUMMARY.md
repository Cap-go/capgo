# Capgo Preview System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

I've successfully set up a complete Cloudflare preview deployment system for Capgo that automatically creates preview environments for every pull request.

### üèóÔ∏è What Was Created

1. **GitHub Workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview_deploy.yml`)
   - Triggers on PR open, synchronize, and reopened events
   - Deploys frontend to Cloudflare Pages with PR-specific naming
   - Deploys all three Workers (API, Files, Plugin) with preview configurations
   - Automatically comments on PRs with preview URLs
   - Cleans up resources when PRs are closed

2. **Configuration Updates**
   - Updated `configs.json` with preview environment settings
   - Modified `scripts/utils.mjs` to handle preview branch logic
   - Added preview environment variables for all services

3. **Preview Scripts**
   - `scripts/generate_preview_config.mjs` - Generates dynamic wrangler configs
   - `scripts/cleanup_preview.mjs` - Handles resource cleanup
   - Added npm scripts for manual preview management

4. **Documentation** (`docs/PREVIEW_SYSTEM.md`)
   - Complete guide on how the system works
   - Troubleshooting and manual operation instructions
   - Security and cost considerations

### üöÄ How It Works

When you create a pull request:

1. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Frontend deployed to: `https://capgo-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.pages.dev`
   - API Worker: `https://capgo-api-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`
   - Files Worker: `https://capgo-files-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`
   - Plugin Worker: `https://capgo-plugin-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`

2. **PR Integration**
   - Bot automatically comments with all preview URLs
   - Updates comment when new commits are pushed
   - Shows build status and commit information

3. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - All resources deleted when PR is closed/merged
   - Confirmation comment posted after cleanup

### üîß Required Setup

To activate the system, ensure these GitHub secrets are configured:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Token with Pages and Workers permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `VITE_VAPID_KEY` - Existing Vapid key for PWA
- `VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG` - Existing Firebase configuration

### üéØ Key Features

- **Isolated Environments**: Each PR gets its own complete environment
- **Dynamic Naming**: Resources named with PR numbers to avoid conflicts
- **Automatic Updates**: Preview updates on every new commit
- **Smart Cleanup**: Resources automatically removed when PR closes
- **Cost Efficient**: Uses Cloudflare's free tier resources
- **Secure**: Uses development credentials, no production data exposed

### üìã Manual Commands

You can also manage previews manually:

```bash
# Deploy complete preview for PR #123
export PR_NUMBER=123
npm run deploy:preview:all

# Cleanup preview environment
npm run cleanup:preview
```

The system is now ready to use! Create a pull request to see it in action.

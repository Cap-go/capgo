# Capgo Preview System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

I've successfully set up a **simplified** Cloudflare preview deployment system
for Capgo that automatically creates preview environments for every pull request
using **production configuration**.

### 🏗️ What Was Created

1. **GitHub Workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview_deploy.yml`)
   - Triggers on PR open, synchronize, and reopened events
   - Uses production build process (`bun mobile`)
   - Deploys frontend to Cloudflare Pages with PR-specific naming
   - Deploys workers using production configs with preview names
   - Automatically comments on PRs with preview URLs
   - Cleans up resources when PRs are closed

2. **Documentation** (`docs/PREVIEW_SYSTEM.md`)
   - Complete guide explaining the production-based approach
   - Security considerations for production database usage
   - Troubleshooting and monitoring instructions

### 🚀 How It Works

**Key Principle**: Use production configuration but deploy to preview URLs

When you create a pull request:

1. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Uses same build as production: `bun mobile`
   - Deploys to: `https://capgo-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.pages.dev`

2. **Worker Deployment**
   - Takes existing production `wrangler.jsonc` configs
   - Modifies only the worker name and removes custom domains
   - Deploys to:
     - `https://capgo-api-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`
     - `https://capgo-files-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`
     - `https://capgo-plugin-preview-{PR_NUMBER}.workers.dev`

3. **Configuration**
   - **Same** database connections as production
   - **Same** environment variables as production
   - **Same** secrets and API keys as production
   - **Only difference**: Preview URLs instead of custom domains

### 🔧 Required Setup

To activate the system, ensure these GitHub secrets are configured:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Token with Pages and Workers permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `VITE_VAPID_KEY` - Existing Vapid key for PWA
- `VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG` - Existing Firebase configuration

### 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Realistic Testing**: Uses actual production environment
- **Zero Configuration Drift**: Always in sync with production
- **Simplified Maintenance**: No duplicate configs or custom scripts
- **Fast Deployment**: Reuses existing production build process
- **Cost Efficient**: Uses Cloudflare's free tier for previews

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

**Production Database Usage**: Preview environments connect to the same
databases as production, which means:

- ✅ Realistic testing with real data
- ⚠️ Preview changes can affect production data
- 🔒 Test carefully on preview environments
- 💡 Consider adding preview-specific safeguards in your application

### 📋 What Was Removed/Simplified

Compared to the initial implementation:

- ❌ No custom preview configurations in `configs.json`
- ❌ No custom preview scripts (`generate_preview_config.mjs`,
  `cleanup_preview.mjs`)
- ❌ No custom npm scripts for preview management
- ❌ No preview-specific environment variables
- ✅ Simple production config modification approach

### 🔄 Workflow Process

```bash
# Production build process (same as always)
bun mobile

# Worker config transformation (automatic)
jq '.name = "capgo-api-preview-123" | .workers_dev = true | del(.route) | del(.routes)' \
  cloudflare_workers/api/wrangler.jsonc > /tmp/wrangler-api-preview.json

# Deploy to preview URLs
bunx wrangler deploy --config /tmp/wrangler-api-preview.json
```

The system is now **much simpler** and ready to use! Create a pull request to
see it in action - it will deploy your changes using the exact same
configuration as production, just to preview URLs.

This approach provides the most realistic testing environment possible while
keeping the implementation extremely simple and maintainable.

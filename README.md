## Usage

Capgo is deployed to production on Cloudflare workers and Supabase.

Cloudflare workers take 99% of the traffic. Supabase is used for internal calls,
for internal tasks such as CRON jobs that call functions.

When self-hosted, installing only Supabase is sufficient.

## Why Cloudflare Workers + Supabase

We support both deployments for practical reasons:

- **Supabase** is the legacy backend and the only required piece for
  self-hosting.
- **Cloudflare Workers** runs the same backend code (via the Hono adapter) but is
  much cheaper at Capgo scale. With ~50M devices, Supabase Edge Functions are
  cost-prohibitive because they follow AWS pricing. Cloudflare is ~10x cheaper
  for our traffic profile.

In production, we route most traffic through Cloudflare Workers for cost and
scale, while Supabase remains the reference backend and the default for
self-hosted deployments. Private endpoints and trigger/CRON workloads still run
on Supabase in production.

## Project structure (self-hosting map)

If you're self-hosting, the key pieces live in a few top-level directories:

- `supabase/` - **Primary backend for self-hosting**
  - `supabase/functions/` - Edge functions (Deno) that power the API
    - `_backend/` - Core implementation used by both Supabase and Cloudflare
    - `public/` - Public API routes used by customers and apps
    - `private/` - Internal API routes for the console and ops tooling
    - `plugins/` - Plugin endpoints (updates, stats, channel_self, etc.)
    - `triggers/` - Database triggers and CRON functions
  - `supabase/migrations/` - Database schema and RLS policies
  - `supabase/seed.sql` - Local seed data for tests/dev
- `supabase/schemas/prod.sql` - Production schema dump (reference only)
- `cloudflare_workers/` - **Optional** Cloudflare Workers deployment (prod traffic)
  - `cloudflare_workers/snippet/` - Geo routing for replicas
  - Worker entry points and deploy config live here
- `src/` - Frontend Vue 3 web console (Vite + Tailwind + DaisyUI)
  - `src/pages/` - File-based routes
  - `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/services/` - API clients and integrations
  - `src/stores/` - Pinia stores
- `sql/` - Raw SQL helpers and maintenance scripts
- `scripts/` - Dev/build scripts used by CI and local tooling
- `tests/` - Backend Vitest tests (run in parallel)
- `playwright/` - Frontend E2E tests
- `docs/` - Extra documentation and guides
- `android/`, `ios/` - Capacitor native projects (mobile builds)

Quick self-hosting path:

1. `supabase/` is enough to run the backend locally.
2. `src/` is the web console you point to your own backend.
3. `cloudflare_workers/` is only needed if you want to run the Workers layer
   instead of (or in front of) Supabase.

## Backend endpoints (what lives where)

The backend is split by responsibility to keep routes clear and access scoped:

- `supabase/functions/_backend/public/` - **Public API** exposed to customers.
  This is the documented API on the website for customers that want to interact
  with Capgo programmatically (apps, channels, bundles, devices, etc.).
- `supabase/functions/_backend/private/` - **Private API** used internally.
  The console (web UI) uses this heavily for admin/ops workflows. It is not
  publicly accessible. Some UI flows still use the public API where appropriate.
- `supabase/functions/_backend/plugins/` - **Plugin API** used by the
  `@capgo/capacitor-updater` plugin running inside apps:
  - `updates` - device update checks and bundle download flow
  - `stats` - upload usage stats from devices
  - `channel_self` - allow a device to opt into a channel (QA/debug)
- `supabase/functions/_backend/triggers/` - **Triggers & CRON** for automated
  backend jobs (queue consumers, scheduled tasks, DB-triggered flows).

When self-hosting, you generally expose `public` + `plugins`. `private` should
stay internal and locked down. `triggers` runs automatically.

## Production schema (prod.sql)

`supabase/schemas/prod.sql` is a schema dump of the production database. It is
generated via `bun run schemas` (or `bun run schemas:local`) and is meant for
reference/diffing, not as a source of truth. All actual schema changes live in
`supabase/migrations/`.

## Tests

Tests are split by backend (API/plugin), CLI, database SQL, and frontend:

- `tests/` - Backend Vitest tests (API + plugin + CLI)
- `playwright/e2e/` - Frontend Playwright tests
- `supabase/tests/` - SQL tests for functions, RLS, and DB logic

Backend test groups (Vitest):

- API tests: public/private endpoints and general backend behavior
- Plugin tests: `tests/updates*.test.ts`, `tests/stats*.test.ts`,
  `tests/channel_self*.test.ts`
- CLI tests: `tests/cli*.test.ts` (CLI auth, upload, metadata, etc.)

Run tests:

```bash
# Supabase Edge Functions (default)
bun test:all
bun test:backend
bun test:cli
bun test:local
bun test:front

# Database SQL tests (Supabase CLI)
supabase test db

# Cloudflare Workers
bun test:cloudflare:all
bun test:cloudflare:backend
bun test:cloudflare:updates

# Local Cloudflare Workers (required for cloudflare tests)
./scripts/start-cloudflare-workers.sh
```

Notes:

- Tests run in parallel across files. If a test mutates shared data, add
  dedicated seed data in `supabase/seed.sql`.
- `LOCAL_CLI_PATH=true bun test:all:local` uses a local CLI build.
- SQL tests in `supabase/tests/` are run by the Supabase CLI test runner.
- Run `bun run supabase:start` first so the local DB is available (worktree-isolated).

### Deploy on Cloudflare Pages

Use the CLI to deploy to preprod

```bash
bun run dev-build
# then deploy
bun run deploy:cloudflare:console:preprod
```

or Prod

```bash
bun run build
# then deploy
bun run deploy:cloudflare:console:prod
```

### Development

You will need to start each local server in separate terminals.

Before continuing, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)

You can install the `supabase` CLI globally with `bun install supabase -g` and
you'll be able to invoke `supabase` from anywhere.

Alternatively, you can install the `supabase` CLI locally with
`bun install supabase --save-dev` but, to invoke it, you have to use:
`./node_modules/supabase/bin/supabase`.

In the following guideline, we will assume that you have installed the
`supabase` CLI globally.

#### Start Supabase DB Locally

Start the Supabase DB:

```bash
bun run supabase:start
```

Ports may differ per git worktree. To see the exact URLs/keys for the current worktree run:

```bash
bun run supabase:status
```

#### Seed Supabase DB locally

[!WARNING] ⚠️ Ensure Docker is running.

```bash
bun run supabase:db:reset
```

#### Start Frontend locally

```bash
bun install
bun serve:local
```

#### Login

Visit http://localhost:5173

There are two login credentials you can use:

| Account    | Username        | Password   |
| ---------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Demo User  | test@capgo.app  | testtest   |
| Admin User | admin@capgo.app | adminadmin |

The _demo user_ account has some demo data in it. If the data is not fresh, just
reset the db with `supabase db reset`. The seed has been made in a way that
ensures the data is always fresh.

The _admin user_ account has administration rights so the user can impersonate
other users. You can find the interface for that in the "Account" section.

#### Supabase DB Reset

[!WARNING] ⚠️ Ensure Docker is running.

This will seed the DB with demo data.

```bash
supabase db reset
```

### Deploy Supabase self hosted

To deploy the supabase instance in self-hosted, use the
[Supabase official guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting).

Before deploying, duplicate `supabase/functions/.env.example` to
`supabase/functions/.env`, replace the placeholder values with your
self-hosted credentials, and keep the file local (it is gitignored). Use that
file for commands such as
`supabase secrets set --env-file supabase/functions/.env`.

### Deploy Supabase cloud

To deploy the Supabase instance on cloud, you need a paid account, which costs
$25/month.

Link the project to the cloud with the following command:

```bash
supabase link
```

https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-link

Then you need to push the migrations to the cloud with the following command:

```bash
supabase db push --linked
```

https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-migration-up

And seed the DB with demo data:

```bash
supabase seed buckets
```

https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-seed-buckets

Seed the secret for functions:

```bash
supabase secrets set --env-file supabase/functions/.env
```

Push the functions to the cloud:

```bash
supabase functions deploy
```

### Environment Variables for Self-Hosted Deployments

By default, the configuration uses Capgo production values from [configs.json](configs.json). For self-hosted deployments, you **must override** all configuration values using environment variables.

#### Required Environment Variables

All configuration keys from `configs.json` can be overridden by setting their uppercase equivalent as environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default (Prod) | Required for Self-Hosted |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| `BASE_DOMAIN` | Console domain | `console.capgo.app` | ✅ Yes |
| `SUPA_ANON` | Supabase anonymous key | Capgo production key | ✅ Yes |
| `SUPA_URL` | Supabase URL | `https://xvwzpoazmxkqosrdewyv.supabase.co` | ✅ Yes |
| `API_DOMAIN` | API domain | `api.capgo.app` | ✅ Yes |
| `CAPTCHA_KEY` | Turnstile captcha key | Capgo production key | ⚠️ Optional |

#### Example Self-Hosted Configuration

```bash
# .env file for self-hosted deployment
BASE_DOMAIN=console.yourdomain.com
SUPA_ANON=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPA_URL=https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co
API_DOMAIN=api.yourdomain.com
CAPTCHA_KEY=your-turnstile-key
```

#### How It Works

The configuration system (`scripts/utils.mjs`) checks for environment variables first:
1. If an uppercase environment variable exists (e.g., `SUPA_URL`), it uses that value
2. Otherwise, it falls back to the appropriate value from `configs.json` based on the branch (`prod`, `preprod`, `development`, or `local`)

**Important:** Without setting these environment variables, your self-hosted instance will attempt to connect to Capgo's production infrastructure, which will fail.

### Build

To build the web app in mobile, in order to push to mobile stores, run:

```bash
bun install
bun mobile
```

And you will see the generated files in the `dist` directory, ready to be served
on stores.

# Test user matrix

Legend: R = reads user records only (no direct auth/public users writes detected); W = writes user records (create/update/delete/SQL).

Notes:
- “Parallel compatibility” is a heuristic: “Isolated” means only dedicated users or single-use users detected; “Shared” means users are reused across multiple tests.
- If a test writes to auth/public users, it should use dedicated users or cleanup per test to be safe in parallel runs.

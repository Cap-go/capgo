// src/build/onboarding/ios/progress.ts
//
// TOTAL iOS resume routing.
//
// `getIosResumeStep` extends the PARTIAL `getResumeStep` (in ../progress.ts)
// into a TOTAL resume over persisted state, exactly as `getAndroidResumeStep`
// did for android. It adds the FRONT gates that, on main, live only as
// `setStep` calls inside the ink TUI (and so are invisible to a stateless
// resume):
//
//   Phase 0 — data-safety gate (`_credentialsExistGate`)
//             'pending' → credentials-exist   (backup-or-cancel choice)
//             'backup'  → backing-up          (the backup effect must still run)
//   (The former Phase 1/1b confirm-app-id gates are gone: PR #2397 removed the
//   confirm-app-id step — the driver silently adopts the authoritative Release
//   bundle id and the remote verify-app step, routed by `getResumeStep` in
//   ../progress.ts, now owns the bundle-id invariant.)
//
// Everything AFTER the gates — the create-new / import `.p8`-chain / cert /
// profile → `saving-credentials` routing — is delegated VERBATIM to the
// existing `getResumeStep`, so:
//   - the intentional `verifying-key` round-trip on import app_store resume is
//     preserved (risk #4 in the audit): when all three .p8 inputs are present
//     `getResumeStep` returns `verifying-key`, never short-circuiting on
//     `completedSteps.apiKeyVerified`;
//   - the existing exported `getResumeStep` stays byte-for-byte unchanged (the
//     ink TUI still imports it), so its regression tests stay green.
//
// BATCH 0 deliberately does NOT route into the post-save tail — the terminal
// here stays `saving-credentials` exactly as `getResumeStep` returns it. The
// shared-tail routing (Phase 2 in the audit) is added in BATCH 1.
//
// CRITICAL — resume can ONLY land on persisted-state-derivable steps. The
// ephemeral import picker steps (`import-pick-identity` / `import-pick-profile`,
// `import-checking-apple-cert`, `import-validating-all-certs`,
// `import-no-match-recovery`, the recovery sub-steps) are NEVER resume targets:
// on resume the engine lands on `import-scanning` (or the .p8 chain), the scan
// effect re-populates the ephemeral inventory into transient, and the picker is
// re-rendered. This contract is inherited from `getResumeStep` (it returns
// `import-scanning`, not a picker) — the gates added here never introduce a
// picker target either.
//
// PURE / IO-FREE — this function only reads `progress`; it never performs an FS
// read (the bundle-id resolution is a SYNC FS read done by the DRIVER, which
// persists the result as `iosBundleIdOverride` / `iosBundleIdContextAppId`).

/**
 * Post-save "tail" resume routing (shared model with android's `tailResumeStep`).
 *
 * Once `saving-credentials` completes, the wizard runs the platform-neutral tail:
 *   ask-build → requesting-build → detecting-ci-secrets → (ci-secrets sub-flow)
 *   → uploading-ci-secrets → (with-workflow) pick-package-manager →
 *   pick-build-script → preview/writing-workflow-file → build-complete
 * with a parallel `.env`-export leaf (ask-export-env → exporting-env) taken when
 * the user declines the GitHub Actions setup. This is the SAME derivation the
 * android engine uses (`android/progress.ts`'s `tailResumeStep`) — the iOS engine
 * delegates the tail EFFECTS to the same shared module (`tail/flow.ts`), so the
 * resume routing into it must match android's step-for-step.
 *
 * Resume here is GUARDED by the three irreversible-side-effect markers
 * (`credentialsSaved`, `buildRequested`, `ciSecretsUploaded`). The router never
 * returns a step that would re-fire a side-effect that already has its marker:
 *   - no `buildRequested`  → land on the `ask-build` user gate (never auto-fire
 *                            `requesting-build`, so resume can't double-build)
 *   - `buildRequested` but no `ciSecretsUploaded` → land on the read-only
 *                            `detecting-ci-secrets` (or `checking-ci-secrets`
 *                            once a target is chosen) — never `uploading-ci-secrets`
 *   - `ciSecretsUploaded`  → only the (idempotent) workflow-builder choice/input
 *                            steps or the terminal `build-complete` remain
 *
 * Returns `null` when no tail marker is present, so `getIosResumeStep` keeps
 * returning whatever `getResumeStep` derives (the terminal `saving-credentials`)
 * exactly as before — legacy/in-flight progress files (which never carry these
 * markers) are completely unaffected.

// Typed boundary around `@capacitor/cli` deep subpath imports.
//
// `@capacitor/cli` ships no type declarations for `dist/config` or
// `dist/util/monorepotools`. These were previously typed via an ambient
// `declare module` file, but an ambient declaration is only honored when the
// module does not otherwise resolve — which is environment dependent (it
// passes locally but fails under CI's `tsgo`, where the package is installed
// and resolves to the untyped `.js`, yielding TS7016 on every PR touching
// `cli/`). Centralizing the untyped imports here keeps the rest of the CLI
// fully typed while the bundler still resolves the real package at runtime.

# Project Brief: Capgo

## Project Overview

Capgo is a comprehensive over-the-air (OTA) update platform for Capacitor
applications, providing instant updates without going through app stores. The
project consists of a full-stack web application that enables developers to
manage, deploy, and track app updates in real-time.

## Core Mission

Enable mobile app developers to deliver instant updates to their Capacitor
applications while providing comprehensive analytics, user management, and
deployment automation tools.

## Key Problems Solved

1. **App Store Delays**: Eliminates the need to wait for app store approval for
   critical updates
2. **User Engagement**: Ensures users always have the latest features and bug
   fixes
3. **Development Velocity**: Accelerates deployment cycles with automated update
   management
4. **Update Analytics**: Provides detailed insights into update adoption and
   performance
5. **Multi-environment Support**: Manages different update channels (production,
   staging, development)

## Primary Features

### Core Update System

- **Instant Updates**: Deploy web assets instantly to mobile apps
- **Channel Management**: Organize updates by environment (prod, staging, dev)
- **Version Control**: Track and manage different app versions
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback to previous versions if issues arise

### Developer Tools

- **CLI Integration**: Command-line tools for automated deployment
- **Web Dashboard**: Comprehensive management interface
- **API Access**: Full REST API for custom integrations
- **Testing Environment**: Sandbox for testing updates before release

### Analytics & Monitoring

- **Update Analytics**: Track adoption rates and performance metrics
- **Device Management**: Monitor individual device update status
- **Error Tracking**: Capture and analyze update-related issues
- **Usage Statistics**: Detailed insights into app usage patterns

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 with Composition API, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **Backend**: Multi-platform deployment (Cloudflare Workers primary backup,
  Supabase internal)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Mobile**: Capacitor with native plugins
- **Build System**: Vite with custom Rolldown integration

## Target Users

1. **Mobile App Developers**: Primary users managing Capacitor applications
2. **Development Teams**: Collaborative update management
3. **Product Managers**: Analytics and deployment oversight
4. **DevOps Engineers**: Automated deployment integration

## Business Model

- Subscription-based service with tiered pricing
- Free tier for development and small projects
- Paid tiers for production apps with additional features and higher limits

## Success Metrics

1. **Update Speed**: Time from deployment to user device
2. **Adoption Rate**: Percentage of users receiving updates
3. **Developer Experience**: CLI usage and dashboard engagement
4. **Platform Growth**: Number of apps and developers using the service
5. **System Reliability**: Update success rates and uptime

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- OTA update management and delivery
- Developer dashboard and analytics
- CLI tools and API
- Multi-environment support
- Device and user management

### Out of Scope

- Native app development
- App store submission tools
- Third-party integrations beyond core update functionality

## Key Constraints

- **Security**: Must ensure secure update delivery and validation
- **Performance**: Updates must be delivered quickly and reliably
- **Compatibility**: Support for various Capacitor versions and plugins
- **Scale**: Must handle high-volume update distribution
- **Cost**: Optimize for efficient resource usage across deployment platforms

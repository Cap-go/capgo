# bundle, then verify against the same designated requirement the CLI enforces
# at runtime — a cert/team mismatch fails the release, not the user.

# The bundle identifier (app.capgo.cli.helper) comes from Info.plist; it is part
# of the designated requirement and keys the Keychain "Always Allow" grant, so

#   APPLE_KEY_ID            App Store Connect API key id
#   APPLE_ISSUER_ID         App Store Connect API key issuer
#   APPLE_KEY_PATH          path to the API key .p8 file
